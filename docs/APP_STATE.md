# App State and Handoff

This is the living handoff doc for the web app's current state. Use it to capture UI
behavior, coupled state, implementation gotchas, and lessons that are easy to miss when
reading code alone.

## How Agents Should Use This

1. Read this file before changing UI-heavy or stateful parts of the app.
2. Read any more specific doc in `docs/` that matches the feature area you are touching.
3. After meaningful work, update this file or the feature-specific doc with what changed,
   what was learned, and any non-obvious behavior the next agent should know.

If a lesson belongs in a dedicated feature doc, add it there and leave a short pointer in
this file so future agents can find it quickly.

## What To Record

- Subtle UI expectations or interaction rules that are not obvious from reading the code.
- State coupling across components, services, persistence keys, or responsive layouts.
- Known constraints, sharp edges, and regression risks discovered during implementation.
- Follow-up work or unresolved questions that the next agent should evaluate.

Keep entries concise and factual. Prefer short bullets over long narratives.

## Current Notes

- 2026-03-08: Established this file as the canonical handoff log for ongoing web-app
  state. Future agents should read it before UI-heavy work and update it after learning
  something that is not obvious from the code alone.
